        Determine if a 9 x 9 Sudoku board is valid. 
        Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:

        1.Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
        2.Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
        3.Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
        
        Note:
        A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
        Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.

        Constraints:
        board.length == 9
        board[i].length == 9
        board[i][j] is a digit 1-9 or '.'.
